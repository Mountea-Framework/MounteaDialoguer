# Mountea Dialoguer

> Mountea Dialoguer is a visual dialogue design platform for teams building narrative-driven games and interactive experiences.
> It helps writers, narrative designers, and technical designers collaborate on branching conversations that are structured, testable, and production-ready.

> **Try it out!**
> Feel free to test out the released version of our Dialoguer Tool!

## Who Is It For
> Mountea Dialoguer is built to solve one core problem:
> turning dialogue ideas into scalable, maintainable conversation systems.
>
> It is intentionally **game-engine agnostic**.
> It can be used with Unreal Engine, Unity, and any other runtime/toolchain that can consume structured dialogue data.
>
> It is made for **lightweight narrative and content design workflows**,
> especially for non-technical users who should not need heavy engine setups just to design and iterate dialogue.
>
> Use it to design branching NPC conversations and quest interactions,
> organize dialogue logic and reusable metadata,
> and prepare clean dialogue packages for production pipelines.
## How It Works
> Mountea Dialoguer is project-based.
>
> A project is your narrative workspace.
> Each project contains dialogues.
> Each dialogue is authored as a visual graph.
>
> Teams can build flow logic with nodes, conditions, decorators, categories, and participants,
> then preview behavior and validate paths before implementation.
>
> This creates a single, shared source of truth for narrative content,
> easier to review and maintain than disconnected spreadsheets or docs.

## The Dialoguer
> The tool comes rich in features, free and available on desktop, tablet and mobile!
> And it provides nice dark/light modes to please as many users as we can.

## AI

> We intend to use as little AI as we possibly can.
